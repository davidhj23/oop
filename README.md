# OOP

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm, that is, a programming model or style that gives us guidelines on how to work with it. It is based on the concept of classes and objects. This type of programming is used to structure a software program into simple and reusable pieces of code blueprints (classes) to create individual instances of objects.

## 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

**Abstraction:** Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.

**Encapsulation:** Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.

**Inheritance:** Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.

**Polymorphism:** Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.
